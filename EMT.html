        <h2>What is an EMT?</h2>
        <p>An emergency medical technician (EMT) is a medical professional that provides emergency medical services. EMTs are most commonly found serving on ambulances.</p>
        <p>EMTs have emergency care skills, from bag-valve-mask ventilation and oxygen administration to the assessment and management of patients presenting with a spectrum of maladies.</p>
        <p>Anyone can become an EMT! The age requirement is 16 years old to begin training.</p> <br>
        <p>EMTs are the second level of training on this section of emergency medical services (EMS).</p>
        <p>The order of knowledge goes: EMR, EMT, AEMT, and Paramedic (Their courses are 800 hours long plus 600 hours of clinical time!).</p>
        <br>
        <h2>How can I get certified?</h2>
        <p>Well first, you need to attend a rigorous class spanning around 190 hours. It has the workload equivalent to two college classes.</p>
        <p>Being around other likeminded students is a great way to grow your love of the medical field. They all share your passion, so don't be afraid to talk about your interests!</p>
        <p>After this, you will be authorized to take the NREMT certification exam! It is graded upon a pass/fail basis, meaning no percentages are involved. If you pass, you become an EMT.</p>
